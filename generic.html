							<h1 class="major">Dragon Figure Project</h1>
				
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> This project involved the development of a Dragon figure withing a group of 3 people. On this page, the development behind the project is shared.</p>
							<h2> Planning </h2>
							<p>When planning, the project focused on three different areas that cover the initial requiremest for the design. This areas are, Idea, Budget, and Technologies.</p>
							<h3> Ideas </h3>
							<p> For the project, three main ideas were brought up from the project team: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Talking Rock: The idea behind this rock was to add eyes and a mouth to it. The mouth would be able to move, giving the impression of it talking. Furthermore, the rock would be able to make sounds whenever the mouth would open. </li>
								<li>Purple Worm: This idea involves recreating a purple worm from dungeons and dragon, the goal with this idea was to make the purple worm to wiggle given it the impression of moving around for a dungeons and dragons campaign.</li>
								<li>Red Dragon: Lastly, recreating a red dragon from dungeons and dragons. This idea wants to achieve a red dragon that moves its mouth and tail to make it look like its alive for a dungeons and dragons campaign </li> 
							<h3>Budget</h3>
							<p>For this project, the budget provided was Â£150, this budget should be enough to cover all aspects of the project, such as, 3d printing, purchasing materials and binding screws.</p>
							<h3>Technologies</h3>
							<p> There are multiple types of technologies which are worth mentioning and can help with the development and design of the choosen project.</p>
							<h4>3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities</h4>
							<p> 3D scanning is a process that captures the physical shape and dimensions of an object to create a digital version in the respective software. It works by suing special equipment such as lasers, structured light patterns, or cameras to collect data points from the surface of an object. The software plays a crucial role in the processing of the object, converting the raw 3d object through point cloud processing , mesh generation, and computer-aided design (CAD). In terms of the workshop facilities, refers to the necessary environment required for conducting a 3D scan. They are used on the surface where the scanning usually happens, and they are small stickers with an image of a black or white dot printed on it (Sargentis et al., 2022). </p>
							<h4>Motion capture hardware, software, and stage facilities</h4>
							<p>Motion capture utilises specialised hardware, such as markers attached to subjects, to accurately track and record their movements in a three-dimensional space by using high-speed cameras. The results are then processed using motion capture software such as Rokoko, which synchronises camera feeds, calibrates the systems, and reconstructs the movements into usable data. When working with motion capture, whether in a small studio or a large sound stage, there are some requirements to capture the best results, providing proper lighting and infrastructure for capturing performances. These stages are essential for various industries, such as film, gaming, streaming, facilitating the creation of lifelike animations, realistic games, etc (Menolotto et al., 2020).</p>
							<h4>Computer Aided Design (CAD) software package</h4>
							<p>Computer-Aided Design software helps designers and engineers create digital objects for anything, from buildings, gears, screws, joints, and hinges. Popular programs, such as Fusion360, let users draw in 2D or 3D, making it very versatile and easy to visualise and refine their designs. These types of tools are essential for speeding up the developing process and ensuring accurate results since these designs are intended to be used in the real world once finished (Shelare et al., 2021).</p>
							<h4>3D modelling software</h4>
							<p>3D modelling software allows users to create 3D models of objects, characters, and environments, which are crucial across industries such as animation, gaming, 3D Printing, etc. An example of a well-known software used for 3D modelling is Blender, which is a free and open-source software known for its versatility, powerful modelling tools, and integrated rendering engine (Anamisa et al., 2020).</p>
