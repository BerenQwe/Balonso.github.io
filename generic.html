									  <h2 id="Planning">Planning</h2>
								<p>When planning, the project focused on three different areas that cover the initial requiremest for the design. This areas are, Idea, Budget, and Technologies.</p>
								<h3>Ideas</h3>
								<p>For the project, three main ideas were brought up from the project team:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Talking Rock: The idea behind this rock was to add eyes and a mouth to it. The mouth would be able to move, giving the impression of it talking. Furthermore, the rock would be able to make sounds whenever the mouth would open. </li>
									<li>Purple Worm: This idea involves recreating a purple worm from dungeons and dragon, the goal with this idea was to make the purple worm to wiggle given it the impression of moving around for a dungeons and dragons campaign.</li>
									<li>Red Dragon: Lastly, recreating a red dragon from dungeons and dragons. This idea wants to achieve a red dragon that moves its mouth and tail to make it look like its alive for a dungeons and dragons campaign </li> 
								</ul>
							<h3>Budget</h3>
								<p>For this project, the budget provided was £150, this budget should be enough to cover all aspects of the project, such as, 3d printing, purchasing materials and binding screws.</p>
							<h3>Technologies</h3>
								<p> There are multiple types of technologies which are worth mentioning and can help with the development and design of the choosen project.</p>
							<h4>3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities</h4>
								<p> 3D scanning is a process that captures the physical shape and dimensions of an object to create a digital version in the respective software. It works by suing special equipment such as lasers, structured light patterns, or cameras to collect data points from the surface of an object. The software plays a crucial role in the processing of the object, converting the raw 3d object through point cloud processing , mesh generation, and computer-aided design (CAD). In terms of the workshop facilities, refers to the necessary environment required for conducting a 3D scan. They are used on the surface where the scanning usually happens, and they are small stickers with an image of a black or white dot printed on it (Sargentis et al., 2022). </p>
							<h4>Motion capture hardware, software, and stage facilities</h4>
								<p>Motion capture utilises specialised hardware, such as markers attached to subjects, to accurately track and record their movements in a three-dimensional space by using high-speed cameras. The results are then processed using motion capture software such as Rokoko, which synchronises camera feeds, calibrates the systems, and reconstructs the movements into usable data. When working with motion capture, whether in a small studio or a large sound stage, there are some requirements to capture the best results, providing proper lighting and infrastructure for capturing performances. These stages are essential for various industries, such as film, gaming, streaming, facilitating the creation of lifelike animations, realistic games, etc (Menolotto et al., 2020).</p>
							<h4>Computer Aided Design (CAD) software package</h4>
								<p>Computer-Aided Design software helps designers and engineers create digital objects for anything, from buildings, gears, screws, joints, and hinges. Popular programs, such as Fusion360, let users draw in 2D or 3D, making it very versatile and easy to visualise and refine their designs. These types of tools are essential for speeding up the developing process and ensuring accurate results since these designs are intended to be used in the real world once finished (Shelare et al., 2021).</p>
							<h4>3D modelling software</h4>
								<p>3D modelling software allows users to create 3D models of objects, characters, and environments, which are crucial across industries such as animation, gaming, 3D Printing, etc. An example of a well-known software used for 3D modelling is Blender, which is a free and open-source software known for its versatility, powerful modelling tools, and integrated rendering engine (Anamisa et al., 2020).</p> 
							<h4>Haptic input hardware and associated 3D sculpting software</h4>
								<p>Haptic Input hardware allows digital artists to interact directly with virtual objects. This hardware gives the feeling of texture and pressure feedback. When used for 3D sculping software like Blender, artists can shape digital models as if they were working with clay. Virtual Reality sculpting software allows artists to take it a step further, letting the artist sculpt in virtual reality using haptic feedback. This combination of hardware and software makes digital sculpting a lot more interesting(Li Z et al., 2021).</p>
							<h4>3D printing hardware and workshop facilities</h4>
								<p>3D Printing hardware involves printers, materials, software, and accessories, with different types like Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) and Stereolithography (SLA) printers utilising different materials for different applications. The workshop facilities for 3D printing require organized workspaces, reliable power, safety equipment, and post-processing tools like polishers or sanders. Quality control measures, including inspection tools, ensure the precision and quality of printed parts. Overall, a workshop which is well-equipped allows efficient and precise 3D printing processes(Orzeł et al., 2022).</p>
							<h4>Laser cutting hardware and workshop facilities</h4>
								<p>Laser-cutting hardware consists of machines equipped with laser sources, optics, and computer numerical control (CNC), allowing precise cutting of materials like wood, plastic, and metal. These machines require a stable power supply and adequate ventilation to operate efficiently and safely. Laser-cutting workshops should have appropriate workflow and access to essential safety features such as exhaust systems and emergency stop buttons. Regular maintenance and calibration are crucial to ensure the continued accuracy and reliability of the equipment. Investing in high-quality hardware and workshop facilities is essential for achieving precise fabrication while maintaining a safe working environment (Alsaadawy et al., 2024).</p>
							<h4>Resin production and postproduction, and composite workshop facilities</h4>
								<p>Producing composite materials involves a careful process from resin production to post-production inside the workshop labs. There are various types of resin, such as epoxy, polyester, or vinyl-ester are carefully mixed with different additives to achieve specific properties. Inside a resin lab, moulds are fabricated with precision and caution by applying techniques like hand layup or vacuum fumes. Safety considerations such as appropriate ventilation, gloves, glasses and waste management are mandatory for safeguarding students and workers.</p>
								   
								<h2 id="Developing">Developing</h2>
								    <p> The idea that was chosen in the end was the Red Dragon from dungeons and dragon, this was the development behaind this idea.</p>

							<h4>Overview of the idea</h4>
								<p>As mentioned previously, the goal of designing this red dragon is for it to be able to move its mouth and tail. As it is appropriate, a MoSCoW method will be applied for this project in order to have an overall better idea and approaches to take into consideration.</p>
								<h4>MoSCoW</h4>

									  <tr>
									    <td>The mouth of the red dragon should open; this can be achieved either with a mechanism that can be activated with a button or a hinge that can manually open the mouth.</td>
									    <td> The 3D printed model should be painted using acrylics.</td>
									    <td>LED light in the mouth of the red dragon simulating the effects of fire coming out of its mouth</td>
									    <td>Scale texture for the skin of the red dragon.</td>

								 <h4>3D Scanning</h4>
								 <p>For the design, we decided to 3D scan a Dragon figure that one of the teammates had. To scan the Dragon Figure, HandySCAN 3d was used; this scan took place in one of the 3D scanning labs at the university, and the dragon was placed on top of a table covered with marker stickers. The dragon was scanned a total of three times, importing the scanned figure to VXelemnts, which is the software that is used with HandySCAN 3d. Once all three different angles of the dragon were imported into VXelemnts, a tool called merge scans was used to merge each scan correctly by manually picking three corresponding reference points. After this, the dragon scan was saved as an STL file.</p>
